# mcCodeQuickStart

Okay so just get the file from releases and then go like into a command line
then you just go
```
mcCodeQuickStart.exe <version>
```

if you are on non windows then you know wat to do
if you have nodejs you can juts clone this and go `node main 20w30a`

if you want to compile yourself for some reason, i used pkg for node and then renamed the files
